After 6 days teacher gave hoilday assignments. Everyday we are doing the assignments. In that hoilday some of family went to picnic and some another island. After so many day we came school and its so much fun. We met our friends after so many days so we share what we do in the hoilday and what funny things happened. We were very excited to meet our friends. When we came to school we saw three new faces. After 2 days we saw one more new face.</p>
