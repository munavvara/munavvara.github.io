They are also found in rare dark shallow water areas such as Newzealans's Milford Sound where they can be viewed from an underwater observatory or Via SCUBA driving. In the exhibition we explained the functions of different parts of our body. We explained the functions of Kidney to the students. We also explain the function of Enzymes. We make large structures of Kidneys, digestive system enzymes and many more by the use of different materials for example wood and clay. We get the help from senior students, parents and teachers.</p>
